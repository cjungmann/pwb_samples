# PROJECT "SCANS"

This project will contain several projects that use various
combinations of my Bash utilities, especially the *ate* array table
and *pwb* paging user interface, and sometimes featuring the
*jb* json DOM utility.

Since both *ate* and *pwb* are used in all these examples, neither
project is a natural place for the examples.  That's the
justification for this unusual project.
