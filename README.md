# PROJECT *PWB_SAMPLES*

This project is a collection of scripts that demonstrate
the usefulness of the Bash builtin commands [pwb][git_pwb] and
[ate][git_ate], and how quickly these tools can help one develop
useful command line applications that solve unique problems.

Secondarily, these scripts are here because they solve my
particular problems.  I have made sym-links in `/usr/bin` to many of
these scripts so because I use them frequently.

## NOTEWORTHY SCRIPTS

As I start this document, I am hoping to catalog the useful
scripts and the techniques each one employs.

### pwb_ls

This is the most useful of the scripts.  It presents as a file
manager, omitting several typical features like copy and move, but
being useful to me for viewing Markdown and PDF files with a click
and opening text files for editing or viewing (read-only) with the
click of `e` or `r`.

It is particularly convenient for working with Markdown files.
I select the file, click `e` to work on it.  After saving, I press
`ENTER` to open the Markdown file in **chromium** with a Markdown
extension.
