.SH INTRODUCING PWB, PAGER WITH BENEFITS
.PP
.B pwb
facilitates building applications that present collections of items
on which various actions can be generated.
.B pwb
decides when and where to print something, but delegates to the
Bash script exactly what is printed, which keys are active, and
what is to be done when the keys are pressed.
.PP
The script associated with this introduction is a minimum viable
.B pwb
.RI ( MVP )
application, illustrating the foundation of
.B pwb
development.

.SH BASIC REQUIREMENTS
.SS PWB BASICS
.PP
Assuming the script is prepared as an executable script (see
.B MAKING CALLABLE SCRIPTS
below if that doesn't make sense), any script using
.B pwb
must provide two features, a
.BR "data source" " and a " "print function" .
.PP
The
.B data source
can be any data store whose members can be accessed with an integer
index, like a Bash array.
The
.B print function
must be provided by the script so
.B pwb
can call it to print each line in the content area.
.PP
Given these two items, it is a simple matter to declare and start
a
.B pwb
application.
.SH THE FIRST APP
.PP
Let's walk through the first application, implementing the required
.BR "Data Source "  And " Print Function" .

.SS ESTABLISH DATA SOURCE
.PP
We'll use the simplest data collection available, the files in the
current working directory.  It can be done in a single statement:

.EX
declare -a DIR_FILES=( * )
.EE

.SS IMPLEMENT THE PRINT FUNCTION
.PP
The print function will be called for each line in the content
area of the screen.
.B pwb
positions the cursor before calling, so the print function can simply
start printing.
It will be called for each line to fully-populate the screen, and to
unhighlight the old and highlight the new when the user changes the
selection.
.PP
At the minumum, the print function must
.BR "retrieve the data" ,
and
.BR "print the data" .
.IP
.EX
print_line()
{
   \(sh retrieve the data
   local -i index=\(dq\(Do1\(dq
   local -n pl_dsource=\(dq\(Do2\(dq
   local line=\(dq\(Do{pl_dsource[\(Doindex]}\(dq

   \(sh print the data
   printf \(dq%s\(dq \(dq\(Doline\(dq
}
.EE
.PP
.B Notes on the Code Fragment:
.TP
.B Arguments
In this case we are only using the first two arguments of the six
arguments passed to the callback function.
The arguments are defined below (see
.BR "PRINT LINE ARGUMENTS" )
and in the
.B pwb
man page.
.TP
.B Argument Names
It can be helpful to make named copies of position arguments to
clarify their meaning.
A nameref variable will be necessary to access the array data source.
.TP
.B Prefix for Name of Nameref Variable
The example uses a prefix, based in the function name, on the nameref
variable to avoid the nameref and the variable to which it refers
having the same name.
.TP
.B Data Retrieval
Access the array value using the index into the namereffed variable
.TP
.B Printing
Print the data starting where
.B pwb
has left the cursor.
.TP
.B WARNING: Ignored Line Length \(dq\(Do3\(dq
By ignoring \(dq\(Do3\(dq argument containing the characters
allowed for the line print function, this line print function
risks spoiling the screen by overwriting the bounds allowed by
.BR pwb .
.IP
Normally, a script should carefully heed \(dq\(Do3\(dq to prevent
overflow.
.IP
In this case, where the data source is the file names of this project,
no data item will be long enough to overflow, it is reasonably safe
to ignore \(dq\(Do3\(dq.  
.SS TRUE MINIMUM PRINT
.PP
Directly using positional arguments without naming them, a true
minimum print function, with a Bash array for the data source,
could look like:
.IP
.EX
print_line()
{
   local -n pl_dsource=\(dq\(Do2\(dq
   printf \(dq%s\(dq \(dq\(Do{pl_source[\(Do1]}\(dq
}
.EE


.SS START PWB
.PP
With the resources ready, we can start up
.BR pwb .
The following three lines of code are the minimum essential for
starting a
.B pwb
application:

.EX
enable pwb
pwb declare PHANDLE DIR_FILES \(dq\(Do{DIR_FILES[*]}\(dq print_line
pwb start PHANDLE
.EE
.SH PRINT LINE ARGUMENTS
.B pwb
will call your print function for every line in the content area,
and again when the selection changes to unhighlight the old selection
and to highlight the new.
.PP
.B pwb
calls the function with six arguments as follows.  Most can be
ignored if not needed for the print.
.TS
tab(|);
l lx.
\(Do1|(int) row index in data source
\(Do2|(str) name of the data source
\(Do3|(int) maximum number of characters to print
\(Do4|(int) focus flag, 1 if in focus, 0 if not
\(Do5|T{
(str) name of
.B pwb
handle
T}
\(Do6|(str) name of optional extra data source
.TE
.PP
The significance of the first three arguments have been covered above.
.SS \(Do4 FOCUS FLAG
.PP
By default,
.B pwb
will handle highlighting the focus line by setting the output mode
to reverse video before calling the print function on the highlighted
line.
For cases when the default behaviour is not desirable, a script can
disable default highlighting with the
.B -h
option to the
.B pwb declare
action, then have the print function consider the focus flag when
deciding if the line should be highlighted or not.
.SS \(Do5 PWB HANDLE
.PP
The controlling
.B pwb
handle is provided in case
.B pwb
information or services might be required while constructing and
delivering the content.
.SS \(Do6 EXTRA DATA
If
.B pwb declare
includes the
.BI -d " extra_data_name"
option, the value for which
.I extra_data_name
stands will be passed to the print functions as argument
.BR \(Do6 .
The script can use the value directly, or if it's a variable name,
access the contents of the named variable using a
.B nameref
variable.
.SH MAKING CALLABLE SCRIPTS
.PP
A script is a text file containing commands recognized by the
interpreter that will process the script.
.PP
A script can be run by invoking the interpreter with the script
name as an argument.  Assuming a Bash script named
.BR do_it ,
the following is an example of this method:
.PP
.RS 7
.EX
$ bash do_it
.EE
.RE
.PP
Scripts are more commonly prepared as self-executing scripts, so
only the script name is needed to run it:
.PP
.RS 7
.EX
$ ./do_it
.EE
.RE
.SS Preparing the script
.PP
A self-executing script has two important characteristics:
.TP
.B Starts with a Shebang
The first line of a self-executing script must start with
.BR #! ,
otherwise known as a \(lqshebang\(rq, refering to the characters
.BR # ,
sh[e]arp and
.BR ! ,
bang.
The shebang is followed by a command the starts the interpreter.
.IP
Some shebang examples:
.IP
.RS 11
.EX
#!/bin/bash
.EE
or
.EX
#!/usr/bin/env bash
.EE
.RE
.IP
The second form is preferable because some systems may not put
.B Bash
in the
.B /bin
directory, but the command
.B env
is always found in
.B /usr/bin
and can find
.B Bash
whereever it is installed.
.TP
.B Has Execution Bits Set
The script must be tagged as executable or invoking it will result in
the message
.IR "permission denied" .
.IP
Set the execution permission with this command:
.IP
.RS 11
.EX
chmod a+x do_it
.EE
.RE
.IP
